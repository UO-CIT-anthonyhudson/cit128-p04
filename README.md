## CIT 281 Project 04

In this project, we had to create a REST API that works with a data source of questions and answers. I created all of the code to work with the data source using a code module. I also created a Node.js REST API to handle the GET verb. 

Throughout the project, I learned how to use the REST API server in VSCode. I also gained experience with using static data. Up until this point, I had not used Postman for an actual webpage I was running.
